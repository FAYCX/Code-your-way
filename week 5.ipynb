    "    The second sketch 'Dismantle data viz' is a music visualization project, was particularly enjoyable for me to create. In today's world, data's ubiquity across domains poses various challengs and opportunities in its application. I deal with data science almost everyday in various ways, but I especially enjoy one aspect of data particularly in the domain of creative codingï¼Œis its computational lingustics expression, and representation in a poetic and artistic manner. I like to believe that the value of seemingly \"useless\" explorations and the joy in simple pleasures, highlighting a profound distinction between artificial intelligence and \n",
