    "#### <span style=\"color:black;line-height:1.5;\">I found this week's coding assignment to be quite engaging, especially when cracking and encoding the code. The output surprised me in ways I couldn't have visualized through the code itself. However, after the first two encoding examples, I gained a better understanding of how to encode and visualize the pattern in my mind. I really enjoyed the encoding exercises because they deepened the connection between coding logic and human interpretation in a more profound way.</span>\n",

I structured it this way so that the pattern could be redrawed and respond to dynamic changes in the user's screen size. As the window size changes dynamically, the pattern adjusts its parameters accordingly. Additionally, I made some tweaks to the x and y coordinates' parameters. At a certain point, the chaotic rectangular patterns align perfectly and symmetrically in the center.\n",

    "#### <span style=\"color:black;line-height:1.5;\">During this week's exercise, in order to create a visually appealing butterfly, I want to deepen my understanding of trigonometry. The question is: Can you please explain the difference between degrees and radians? </span>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <span style=\"color:black;line-height:1.5;\">And here's the answer:</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "Certainly! In trigonometry, the relationship between degrees and radians is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1 radian = 180° / π\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely,\n",
    "\n",
    "1 degree = π / 180 radians\n",
    "\n",
    "So, to convert degrees to radians, you can use the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "radians = degrees * (π / 180)\n",
    "\n",
    "And to convert radians to degrees:\n",
    "\n",
    "degrees = radians * (180 / π)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some common angles converted between degrees and radians:\n",
    "\n",
    "0° = 0 radians\n",
    "30° = π / 6 radians\n",
    "45° = π / 4 radians\n",
    "60° = π / 3 radians\n",
    "90° = π / 2 radians\n",
    "180° = π radians\n",
    "270° = 3π / 2 radians\n",
    "360° = 2π radians\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use these conversions to easily switch between degrees and radians in your trigonometric calculations."
