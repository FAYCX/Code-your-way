    "#### <span style=\"color:black;line-height:1.5;\">Throughout this week's process of encoding information, I've taken the opportunity to revisit and reinforce my understanding of fundamental mathematical functions such as rotation, sine, cosine, and modulo operations. These functions play crucial roles in various computational tasks, from graphics rendering to signal processing.</span>\n",

    "#### <span style=\"color:black;line-height:1.5;\">One concept that stood out to me during this review is the 'blendMode' function, which I encountered for the first time. Upon conducting further research into this function, I discovered that it offers a range of mode parameters that dictate how graphical elements interact and blend with each other on a canvas or screen. \n",

    "LIGHTEST: Retains the lightest color of the two source colors.</br>\n",
    "DIFFERENCE: Subtracts the darker color from the lighter color.</br>\n",
    "MULTIPLY: Multiplies the colors of the two source pixels.</br>\n",
    "EXCLUSION: Similar to difference, but with lower contrast.</br>\n",
    "SCREEN: Inverts the colors, multiplies, and inverts back.</br>\n",
    "REPLACE: Overwrites the destination with the source.</br>\n",

    "HARD_LIGHT: A combination of multiply and overlay for strong contrast.</br>\n",

    "#### <span style=\"color:black;line-height:1.5;\"> During this week, my practice has primarily revolved around practicing rotation through angles and the trigonometric concepts of sine and cosine. Practice these most basic mathematical principles, I created two straightforward yet captivating loading icon animations using P5.js code. These animations feature classic icons often encountered on various applications or websites. To add a sense of playfulness into the animations, I experimented with manipulating both the color parameters and the alpha channel.</span>\n",
